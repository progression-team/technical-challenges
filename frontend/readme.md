Thanks for taking a look at our Frontend Technical Challenge! Please read this document before writing any code üßë‚Äçüíª

## üëâ Brief

One of the most important pages in our application is the Framework page‚Äîit brings together everything you need to
understand what skills are required at every role in your organisation.

At the moment, this page is built using old-school Rails views and jQuery. We need to rebuild this page in React, so we
can make it quicker, more responsive and so that it's easier to add more features.

Here's a lightweight version of the framework page we use in our real production app:
